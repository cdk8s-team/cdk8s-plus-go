// Controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down.
//
// The default policy is `OrderedReady`, where pods are created in increasing order
// (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before
// continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order.
//
// The alternative policy is `Parallel` which will create pods in parallel to match the
// desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once.
